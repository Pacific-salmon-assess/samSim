abstract = {Climate change will likely lead to increasing population variability and extinction risk. Theoretically, greater population diversity should buffer against rising climate variability, and this theory is often invoked as a reason for greater conservation. However, this has rarely been quantified. Here we show how a portfolio approach to managing population diversity can inform metapopulation conservation priorities in a changing world. We develop a salmon metapopulation model where productivity is driven by spatially-distributed thermal tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term climate change. We then implement spatial conservation scenarios that control population carrying capacities and evaluate the metapopulation portfolios as a financial manager might - along axes of conservation risk and return. We show that preserving a diversity of thermal tolerances minimizes risk given environmental stochasticity and ensures persistence given long-term environmental change. When the thermal tolerances of popu...},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. Understanding population-specific spawner–recruit relationships is necessary for sustainable salmon management. Where multiple populations are harvested together, run reconstruction methods partition mixed-stock catches and allocate recruits back to their populations of origin. Traditional run reconstruction methods often use age composition data to inform catch partitioning. However age-only methods do not account for stock-specific differences in the availability of fish to harvest within fishing areas or the incidental harvest of nontarget stocks in nearby fishing areas. Advances in molecular genetic techniques permit genetic stock identification (GSI) of both contemporary and historical catch samples. We present a statistical model for salmon run reconstruction that utilizes both age composition and GSI data to estimate differences in the availability of stocks within, and interception rates among, terminal fisheries. When applied to the commercial sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) fishery in Bristol Bay, Alaska, new estimates of population productivity differed from those generated using previous age-only methods by 0.1{\%}–155.1{\%}, with stock-specific mean absolute percent differences of 9.7{\%}–38.7{\%} across years, underscoring the value of genetic data for run reconstruction. With more accurate run reconstruction methods, spawner–recruit relationships can be identified more precisely, thus providing more accurate management targets for salmon fisheries},

abstract = {We expand on previous analyses of environmental factors related to productivity of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations by analysing data on adult recruits per spawner from 24 wild (not hatchery) Chinook salmon stocks from Oregon through western Alaska. To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used Dynamic Factor Analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America's west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

abstract = {The discipline and practice of fisheries science and management have had an useful, successful, and interesting history. The discipline has developed over the past century and a half into a very reductionist, highly quantitative, socially impactful endeavor. Yet given our collective successes in this field, some notable challenges remain. To address these challenges, many have proposed ecosystem-based fisheries management that takes a more systematic approach to the management of these living marine resources. Here I describe systems theory and associated constructs underlying system dynamics, elucidate how aggregate properties of systems can and have been used, contextualize these aggregate features relative to optimal yield, and note how this approach can produce useful estimates and outcomes for fisheries management. I explore two contrasting examples where this approach has and has not been considered, highlighting the benefits of applying such an approach. I conclude by discussing ways in which we might move forward with a portfolio approach for both the discipline and practice of fisheries science and management.

abstract = {Stock-recruitment models have been used for decades in fisheries management as a means of formalizing the expected number of offspring that recruit to a fishery based on the number of parents. In particular, Ricker's stock recruitment model is widely used due to its flexibility and ease with which the parameters can be estimated. After model fitting, the spawning stock size that produces the maximum sustainable yield (S MSY) to a fishery, and the harvest corresponding to it (U MSY), are two of the most common biological reference points of interest to fisheries managers. However, to date there has been no explicit solution for either reference point because of the transcendental nature of the equation needed to solve for them. Therefore, numerical or statistical approximations have been used for more than 30 years. Here I provide explicit formulae for calculating both S MSY and U MSY in terms of the productivity and density-dependent parameters of Ricker's model.},

@article{Schindler2010,
abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.},

@article{Schnute1995,
abstract = {Catch-age analysis has become a standard tool for modern stock assessment, where it is recognized that population estimates are linked to estimates of the natural mortality rate M. We use state space models and simulation-estimation cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In particular, we design a simulation model with realistic measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from an estimation model simplified to conform with common assumptions. We describe circumstances in which, simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The variance ratio p relating process error in recruitments with measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for p. In general, estimation models perform better when the true p is specified and measurement error is low, so that recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability. Thus, well- designed data collection programs are critical to the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

@article{White2014,
abstract = {The cause of population cycles is a common question in ecology, and one especially puzzling case is the cycles over the past century in populations of sockeye salmon, Oncorhyncus nerka. Some populations of this semelparous species in British Columbia, Canada, exhibit a phenomenon termed cyclic dominance: every four years there is a dominant cohort of primarily four-year-old spawners, orders of magnitude more abundant than other cohorts, producing a distinctive four-year cycle. In some populations, these cycles stop, start, or shift phase. We used a stochastic age-structured model to investigate the conditions allowing cycles and the events that could cause them to move in and out of cyclic dominance. We first defined cyclic dominance as high values of cyclicity, the fraction of time the population is cyclic, and dominance, the difference in abundance between the dominant cohort and the other three cohorts. We then used simulations to determine the values of (1) relative population persistence (i.e., proximity to collapse), (2) variability in survival, (3) variability in growth, and (4) spread in spawning age distribution that led to the observed levels of cyclic dominance in 18 stocks from the Fraser River, British Columbia, and nine stocks from Bristol Bay, Alaska, USA. Our simulations produced a range of dynamics similar to those observed in real stocks, from noncyclic to intermittent cycles to extremely consistent cyclic-dominant cycles. We found that cyclicity and dominance were most likely to be high under conditions of low population persistence, high variability in survival, and narrow age structure. Populations could be driven into cyclic-dominant behavior by unusually large perturbations in survival, but not in individual growth rate. Because this triggering mechanism is stochastic, populations may exist under conditions enabling cycles for a substantial time without displaying cyclic dominance, which is consistent with observations from real stocks. The association between cyclic dominance and low population persistence is of some concern for management. Also, the dependence of cyclic variability on intrinsic population dynamics (albeit stochastically driven) should be taken into account when assessing whether statistically independent fluctuations of stocks produce a biodiversity portfolio effect.},
