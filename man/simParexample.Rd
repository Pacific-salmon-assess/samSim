A dataframe with 45 columns used as input to define simulation scenarios and MP:
\describe{
  \item{scenario}{scenario name. Used in subdirectories names as well as naming CUsrDat output file} 
  \item{nameOM}{operating model name. Used in naming simulation oyutput directories and many output files}
  \item{nameMP}{management procedure name, used in naming output files}
  \item{keyVar}{focal variable of the analysis; subjective since typically multiple variables will differ 
                among scenarios, but should be a focal point of main figures. Currently can be one of the following arguments: `prodRegime`, 
                `synch`, `expRate`, `ppnMix`, `sigma`, `endYear`, `adjustAge`, `mixOUSig`, `adjustForecast`, `adjustEnRoute`, `obsSig`, 
                `obsMixCatch` (**NOTE these should eventually be defined explicitly**)}
  \item{plotOrder}{order in which grouped scenarios will be plotted (useful when keyVar is not an ordinal or numeric variable)}
  \item{species}{lower case species name (chum, sockeye and coho have been tested robustly; pink has not; chinook should be 
                 used with extreme caution since most stocks do not meet assumptions of the model- I am not sure this still holds)}
